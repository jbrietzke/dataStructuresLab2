This lab's goal is to have a working single LinkedList working 

The linkedlist is written in the driver program

The Node class has its own Header file

This version of LinkedList handles appending, deleting, and traversing

The LinkedList is written with its own class definition, it uses the Node and 
Student Class. 

Pointers are used throughout for dynamic memory and the destructors clean up the 
heap mess once the program is finished.
